                                        Our Kia dealers also offer Service Plans which allow you to spread the cost of future servicing through simple monthly payments.
                                        <br> Just like our Care- 3 service packages, Service Plans are based on Kia service schedules including all parts, labour, engine oil and other lubricant requirements.
                                        <br> A Service Plan not only applies to new Kia vehicles, but also to used Kia vehicles. Existing customers can also take up a Service Plan at any time to plan for future service requirements. A bespoke monthly payment plan can be calculated by your Kia dealer based on your model, annual mileage and your desired cover period.
